						<p>
							All notes were taken out of lecture slides as well as the textbook. I've written a brief summary of each
							topic:
						</p>
						<p>Altruism is prosocial behavior that benefits others who are suffering without regard to consequences for
							oneself, often at a personal cost. There are three types of altruistic behavior: social reward-- being
							praised by others, personal distress-- help others to reduce their own distress, and empathy-- identifying
							with someone.
						</p>
						<p>
							Casual attribution is the process individuals used to explain his/her own and others’ behavior by linking
							an event to a cause. They are likely to infer that a personality trait is responsible for a behavior.
							However, these explanations can lead to consequences; for example, attributing a rejection from an
							internship could lead to a lack of ability leads to unhappiness and withdrawal.
						</p>
						<p>
							Compliance is responding favorably to an explicit request by another person. “door in the face” compliance
							approach that involves asking for a first favor that is large and unreasonable, followed by a request for
							a smaller favor, since it’s seen as a concession. Foot-in-the-door technique is compliance that involves
							an initial small request that most people comply with, following up with larger request involving real
							behavior of interest
						</p>
						<p>Culture can often influence thought and norms. In independent cultures, people tend to think of
							themselves
							as distinct social entities, tied to each other by voluntary bonds. In interdependent (collectivistic)
							cultures, people are more likely to define themselves as part of a collective, placing less importance on
							individual freedom or personal control over their lives. East Asian cultures are more interdependent
							whereas
							the West encourages more independent cultures.
						</p>

						<p>
							Effort Justification is one of the paradigms of Cognitive dissonance. Many times we engage in a lot of
							effort for something but it may look disappointing. In other words, the more efforts and sacrifices
							someone puts in to pursue a goal, the more attractive the goal seems.
						</p>

						<p>
							On the topic of attraction, emotional attribution is the theory that nature of arousal can be
							misattributed to another emotion, so the emotion can be diminished, enhanced, or changed. Both positive
							and negative emotions can be attributed. The attachment theory states that there are three types of
							attachment styles, which are formed by how their parents gave attention to them.
						</p>

						<p>
							Sense of Self is defined as the way a person views his or her traits and beliefs. It covers both the
							'inner' and 'outer' self. A sense of self refers to the self being a social entity that is forged largely
							through interactions with others
						</p>
						<p>
							There are two types of social norms: the descriptive norm, which is behavior exhibited by most people in a
							given context, and the prescriptive (injunctive) norm, which is the way a person is supposed to behave in
							a given context. Conformity is changing one’s behavior or beliefs in response to some real or perceived
							pressure from others, sometimes to follow a social norm.
