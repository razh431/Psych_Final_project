            <p>
              There were a few parties over the past weekend, both of which I went to. I’m the only sober person, acting
              as a sober monitor as well as a designated driver. It’s pretty frustrating-- I don’t think most of my
              friends enjoy drinking, but the norm seems as though it is. I make it pretty well known that I don’t
              drink, and everyone always says “I respect that!” I don’t try to change their behavior-- if my friends
              want to drink, they can. I’m already here as an ally, so it should help them stand firm to their own
              beliefs if they don’t want to drink.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think non-conformity is pretty hard in the social world. I’ve never felt pressured by my peers to drink,
              but it seemed as if I was the only one who didn’t. Of course, I’ve been tempted to drink as well; the
              reason being conformity for normative social influence, as I definitely did not want to be seen as the
              outcast.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, in this covid semester, I often felt alone standing my beliefs. I knew about people who cheated
              on prelims by working with other people (have been invited to do so), but I stood firm. It’s not that I do
              well, and it’s frustrating to see my friends do well because they all worked together. I remember texting
              every one of my friends on the prelim asking if they were working with other people, and finally one
              person stood out and said, “no I’m working alone. It just doesn’t feel right to me” That gave me the extra
              strength and validation, that yes, I can do this alone, even at the expense of my grades.
