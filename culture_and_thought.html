            <p>
              I decided to call my family to relay to them the results of the onslaught of prelims. After all, they
              deserved to know after supporting me financially through college. They were concerned-- I was always the
              smarter sibling; I was older, less rebellious. I’ve always had perfect grades and was the role model. When
              I was the only child, I received all their resources and attention, and I guess my younger sister grew up
              “challenging” the status quo of my family. I might be biased though: maybe this self-knowledge is
              reflected from self-appraisal. Growing up constantly under the praise of my parents about me being a role
              model older sister made me believe this about myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              My parents always wanted me to grow up more independent, which was strange since they grew up in East
              Asia. I would’ve thought they respected interdepence more. I was always encouraged to do more things
              alone, stand out, and not conform. I was allowed to explore the city myself, find my own hobbies, do the
              things I wanted to do. I guess we did exercise familialism, but not to the extent of many other Asian
              families as my Dad traveled for work a lot. However, I know a lot of other East Asian friends of mine have
              always prioritized their family over their friends-- I could never invite a friend out during dinner time,
              not because she wasn’t allowed to, but she wanted to spend more time with her family.
            </p>
            <p>
              My parents, who were East Asians, approached my struggles in college from a different context than I--
              they helped me realize that this semester was the result of a multitude of factors, ranging from covid to
              a packed schedule. I, however, took a more individualistic approach and blamed it on myself. Overall, I do
              think I felt better after talking to them, which was strange since I usually suppressed a lot of emotion
              near my East Asian parents.
