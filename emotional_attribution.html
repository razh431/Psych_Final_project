            <p>
              It’s Valentine’s Day, and I would really like to appreciate Boyfriend. When my boyfriend and I met, I
              never thought we would start dating. After running into him in the research lab, same major and year, I
              guess due to the mere exposure effect, we became familiar with each other. Our friendship developed into a
              relationship after a hike on the Cornell suspension bridge. Maybe due to heights, maybe because of him, I
              suddenly felt attraction towards him, and I guess he became my boyfriend shortly after.
            </p>
            <p>
              Boyfriend is rather avoidant in our relationship while I am the opposite. When we started dating, I
              wouldn’t mind hanging out more with him but he seems to need more space. I had lots of trouble
              understanding his perspective-- if he really likes me, shouldn’t he want to hang out with me more? I think
              Boyfriend seems to fear emotional intimacy; maybe his parents did not seem to give him enough time and
              attention-- they were doctors.

            </p>
            <p>
              I think Boyfriend has learned to provide a sense of security and commitment to me. I’m aware of the three
              factors that influence commitment, and he has exceeded all 3. I never compare Boyfriend to alternatives,
              am satisfied, and invested into this relationship. Commitment is linked to longer relationships because it
              increases relationship-promoting behaviors like forgiveness, self-sacrifice.
